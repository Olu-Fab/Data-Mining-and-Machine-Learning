# Data-Science-Projects
In this work, R and SAS Enterprise Miner are used to develop a model to forecast customer 
attrition/churn for a Telecom company using a classification method called the Decision tree. 
Also, the following questions are addressed by project: What factors play a part in 
customer churn? Which customers are most likely to abandon their accounts? Is there 
anything that can be done to keep them from leaving?
