This repository exhibits my understanding and proficiency with data mining techniques 
such as classification, association rule mining, clustering, and sentiment analysis using actual business data. 
The datasets were acquired from well-known and legal repositories while adhering to rigorous data protection guidelines 
and avoiding the use of sensitive data. The datasets were analysed to have a better understanding of their distribution and relationships. 
Additionally, the results of the model implementation of these techniques were analysed and discussed, with appropriate comments made.
This study was completed with the aid of two data mining programmes: R and SAS. Both tools 
were used for analysis and model construction. In this task, the findings of both tools are also 
compared.
